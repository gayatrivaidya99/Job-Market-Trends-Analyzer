We build powerful models that enable Marketers to make the right decisions and engage their customers with personalized content that is timely, relevant, and valuable.  Our approach to building models is an academic one, starting with a literature search, a baseline, and an iterative process of training and validation to identify the most suitable model that is as simple as possible and as powerful as necessary.  We employ a wide variety of models, such as Bayesian models for predicting customer lifetime value, matrix factorization to identify a customer’s product affinity, and reinforcement learning models to optimize content, timing, and frequency of marketing communications. \n",
